# RAILWAY RESET - STOP WASTING MONEY

## The Problem
Railway is caching your old files and ignoring updates. This is why you keep getting the same errors.

## IMMEDIATE SOLUTION: Reset Railway Project

### Step 1: Delete Current Deployment
1. Go to your Railway project dashboard
2. Click **Settings** (gear icon)
3. Click **Delete Project** or **Reset Deployment**

### Step 2: Create Fresh Project
1. Create new Railway project
2. Connect to GitHub repository OR upload fresh files
3. Use the new deployment package: `ruby-discord-bot-railway-final.zip`

### Step 3: Environment Variables
Set these in Railway settings:
```
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
DISCORD_PUG_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_key_here
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_here
```

### Step 4: Force Fresh Build
Railway settings:
- Build Command: `bundle config set --local force_ruby_platform true && bundle install`
- Start Command: `bundle exec ruby pugbot.rb`

## Why This Happens
Railway caches:
- Docker layers
- Gem installations
- Build configurations
- File systems

A fresh project bypasses all cached problems.

## Alternative: Clear All Railway Cache
If you don't want to delete the project:
1. Settings â†’ General
2. Clear all cached builds
3. Redeploy with fresh files

This will cost much less than repeated failed deployments!
