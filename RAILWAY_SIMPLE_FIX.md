# RAILWAY SIMPLE FIX - Stop Wasting Money

## The Real Problem
Railway is trying to use your old Dockerfile that had Alpine Linux commands mixed with Debian base.

## FASTEST SOLUTION

### Option 1: Use Nixpacks (Recommended)
1. **Delete** your current `Dockerfile` from Railway project
2. **Only use** `nixpacks.toml` (already included in zip)
3. Railway will automatically detect Ruby and use Nixpacks
4. Upload: `ruby-discord-bot-fresh-railway.zip`

### Option 2: Clean Docker Build
1. Replace your `Dockerfile` with `Dockerfile.railway` from the zip
2. This uses proper Debian commands (no Alpine mixing)
3. Railway Settings → Build Command: Leave empty
4. Railway Settings → Start Command: `bundle exec ruby pugbot.rb`

## Environment Variables (Required)
```
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key  
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret
```

## Why This Keeps Failing
Your Dockerfile has Alpine Linux user commands (`addgroup -S`) but uses Debian base image. Railway tries to run Alpine commands on Debian = failure.

**Nixpacks is much simpler** - it detects Ruby automatically and handles all the platform stuff for you.

## Cost Saving Tip
Stop the current deployment immediately to avoid more charges. Railway charges for failed builds too.
